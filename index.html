    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>After 6 years of sales leadership and 3 startup companies, I am tired of being envious of the amazing Software
      Engineers
      at my companies, so I have decided it's time to jump in myself! </p>
    <p>Yes, this is a massive pivot in my career, but it is one that I have dreamt about since the day I was exposed. I
      am, and
      will continue to be, a student of constant learning and growth, and the software development / engineering world
      does
      exactly that.</p>
    <p>When I'm not “nerding out” about all things code, you can find me snowboarding on the slopes, playing sand
      volleyball
      and surfing at Vero Beach, or exploring with my two dog children.
